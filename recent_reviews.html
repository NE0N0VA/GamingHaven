            <h3>Hades 2</h3>
            <p>IGN: Even in its Early Access state, Hades 2 is just about everything one could ask for in a sequel to one of the best roguelites of all time. Featuring excellent refinements to its roguelite progression, a fantastic new main character in Melinoe, and two unique sets of levels that have you fighting foes on the surface and in the underworld. [Early Access Review]</p>
            <p>Rock Paper Shotgun: Like the game's own shrouded Narcissus, Hades 2 is already inviting and attractive, even in its unfinished form. [Early Access Review]</p>
            <p>TheGamer: At first, I had my doubts, but now I cannot wait to see how it’s built upon in the year to come, and exactly where these stories and characters will go next. Every single run has memorable dialogue, new discoveries, and deepening relationships with a pantheon worth fighting for. If Hades 2 can keep up this momentum, we could have yet another classic on our hands. [Early Access Review]</p>
            
            <h3>Another Crab's Treasure</h3>
            <p>IGN: Another Crab’s Treasure is one of my favorite soulslikes in quite some time. It borrows a lot from the usual genre playbook, but adds a colorful, irresistibly charming, and wholly unique veneer that makes it all feel brand spanking new. The story is well-written and filled with memorable moments and characters, the shell-swapping mechanic is unique and adorable as heck, and the unrelentingly cheerful mood is like finding land after years adrift in an angsty sea of Bloodborne imitators. Its combat isn’t the deepest ocean around and it has a bit of jank here and there, but Another Crab’s Treasure is so clever and wonderfully ridiculous that it’s absolutely worth your time. [8/10]</p>
            <p>PC Gamer: An undersea soulslike that's cute and compelling, though weirdly crass. [8/10]</p>
            <p>PC Invasion: Another Crab's Treasure is a colorful and lively platformer that's also a tough action RPG with Soulslike combat. They juxtapose each other perfectly, and I had a fun time discovering shells, collecting microplastics, and defeating grueling bosses. [9/10]</p>
